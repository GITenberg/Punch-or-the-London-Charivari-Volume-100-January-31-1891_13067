    <p><i>An Over-heated Matron</i> (<i>to her Husband</i>). Well,
    they don't give you much <i>room</i> in 'ere, I <i>must</i>
    say. Still, we done better than I expected, after all that
    crushing. I thought my ribs was gone once&mdash;but it was on'y
    the umbrella's. You pretty comfortable where you are, eh.
    Father?</p>

    <p><i>Father</i>. Oh, I'm right enough, I am.</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy</i> (<i>their Son; a small boy, with a piping
    voice</i>). If <i>Father</i> is, it's more nor what <i>I</i>
    am. I can't see, Mother, I can't!</p>

    <p><i>His Mother</i>. Lor' bless the boy! there ain't nothen to
    <i>see</i> yet; you'll see well enough when the Curting goes
    up. (<i>Curtain rises on opening scene</i>). Look, JIMMY, ain't
    <i>that</i> nice, now? All them himps dancin' round, and real
    fire comin' out of the pot&mdash;which I 'ope it's quite
    safe&mdash;and there's a beautiful fairy just come on, dressed
    so grand, too!</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy</i>. I can't see no fairy&mdash;nor yet no
    himps&mdash;no nothen! [<i>He whimpers</i>.</p>

    <p><i>His Mother</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Was there ever such a
    aggravating boy to take anywheres! Set quiet, do, and don't
    fidget, and look at the hactin'!</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy</i>. I tell yer I can't <i>see</i> no hactin',
    Mother. It ain't my fault&mdash;it's this lady in front o' me,
    with the 'at.</p>

    <p><i>Mother</i> (<i>perceiving the justice of his
    complaints</i>). Father, the pore boy says he can't see where
    he is, 'cause of a lady's hat in front.</p>

    <p><i>Father.</i> Well, <i>I</i> can't 'elp the 'at, can I? He
    must put up with it, that's all!</p>

    <p><i>Mother.</i> No&mdash;but I thought, if you wouldn't mind
    changing places with him&mdash;you're taller than him, and it
    wouldn't be in your way 'arf so much.</p>

    <p><i>Father.</i> It's always the way with you&mdash;never
    satisfied, <i>you</i> ain't! Well, pass the boy
    across&mdash;I'm for a quiet life, I am. (<i>Changing
    seats.</i>) Will <i>this</i> do for you?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He settles down immediately behind a very large, and
        furry, and feathery hat, which he dodges for some time,
        with the result of obtaining an occasional glimpse of a
        pair of legs on the stage.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Father</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). D&mdash;&mdash; the
    'at!</p>

    <p><i>Mother.</i> You can't wonder at the <i>boy</i> not
    seeing! P'raps the lady wouldn't might taking it off, if you
    asked her?</p>

    <p><i>Father.</i> Ah! (<i>He touches</i> The Owner of the Hat
    <i>on the shoulder.</i>) Excuse me, Mum, but might I take the
    liberty of asking you to kindly remove your 'at? [The Owner of
    the Hat <i>deigns no reply.</i></p>

    <p><i>Father</i> (<i>more insistently</i>). <i>Would</i> you
    'ave any objection to oblige me by taking off your 'at, Mum?
    (<i>Same result.</i>) I don't know if you <i>'eard</i> me, Mum,
    but I've asked you twice, civil enough, to take that 'at of
    yours off. I'm a playin' 'Ide and Seek be'ind it 'ere!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>No answer.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Mother.</i> People didn't ought to be allowed in the
    Pit with sech 'ats! Callin' 'erself a lady&mdash;and settin'
    there in a great 'at and feathers like a 'Ighlander's, and
    never answering no more nor a stuffed himage!</p>

    <p><i>Father</i> (<i>to the Husband of The Owner of the
    Hat</i>). Will you tell your good lady to take her 'at off,
    Sir, please?</p>

    <p><i>The Owner of the Hat</i> (<i>to her Husband</i>). Don't
    you do nothing of the sort, SAM, or you'll <i>'ear</i> of
    it!</p>

    <p><i>The Mother.</i> Some people are perlite, I must say.
    Parties might <i>beyave</i> as ladies when they come in the
    Pit! It's a pity her 'usband can't teach her better
    manners!</p>

    <p><i>The Father.</i> <i>'Im</i> teach her! 'E knows better.
    'E's got a Tartar there, <i>'e</i> 'as!</p>

    <p><i>The Owner of the Hat.</i> SAM, are you going to set by
    and hear me insulted like this?</p>

    <p><i>Her Husband</i> (<i>turning round tremulously</i>).
    I&mdash;I'll trouble you to drop making these personal
    allusions to my wife's 'at, Sir. It's puffickly impossible to
    listen to what's going on on the stage, with all these remarks
    be'ind!</p>

    <p><i>The Father.</i> Not more nor it is to <i>see</i> what's
    going on on the stage with that 'at in front! I paid
    'arf-a-crown to see the Pantermime, I did; not to 'ave a view
    of your wife's 'at!... 'Ere, MARIA, blowed if I can stand this
    'ere game any longer. JIMMY must change places again, and if he
    can't see, he must stand up on the seat, that's all!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[JIMMY <i>is transferred to his original place, and
        mounts upon the seat.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Pittite behind Jimmy</i> (<i>touching up</i> JIMMY's
    Father <i>with an umbrella</i>). Will you tell your little boy
    to set down, please, and not block the view like this?</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy's Father</i>. If you can indooce that lady in front
    to take off her 'at, I will&mdash;but not before. Stay where
    you are, JIMMY, my boy.</p>

    <p><i>The Pittite behind.</i> Well, I must stand myself then,
    that's all. I mean to see, <i>somehow</i>! [<i>He
    rises.</i></p>

    <p><i>People behind him</i> (<i>sternly</i>). Set down there,
    will yer?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He resumes his seat expostulating.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Jimmy</i>. Father, the gentleman behind is a pinching of
    my legs!</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy's Father.</i> Will you stop pinching my little
    boy's legs! He ain't doing you no 'arm&mdash;is he?</p>

    <p><i>The Pinching Pittite</i>. Let him sit down, then!</p>

    <p><i>Jimmy's Father.</i> Let the lady take her 'at off!</p>

    <p><i>Murmurs behind.</i> Order, there! Set down! Put that boy
    down! Take orf that 'at! Silence in front, there! Turn 'em out!
    Shame!... &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>The Husband of the O. of the H.</i> (<i>in a whisper to
    his Wife</i>). Take off the blessed 'at, and have done with it,
    do!</p>

    <p><i>The O. of the H.</i> What&mdash;<i>now</i>? I'd sooner
    <i>die</i> in the 'at!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>An</i> Attendant <i>is called.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Attendant.</i> Order, there, Gentlemen,
    please&mdash;unless you want to get turned out! No standing
    allowed on the seats&mdash;you're disturbing the performance
    'ere, you know!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[JIMMY <i>is made to sit down, and weeps silently; the
        hubbub gradually subsides&mdash;and</i> The Owner of the
        Hat <i>triumphs&mdash;for the moment.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Jimmy's Mother.</i> Never mind, my boy, you shall have
    Mother's seat in a minute. I dessay, if all was known, the lady
    'as reasons for keeping her 'at on, pore thing!</p>

    <p><i>The Father.</i> Ah, I never thought o' that. So she may.
    Very likely her 'at won't <i>come</i> off&mdash;not without her
    <i>'air!</i></p>

    <p><i>The Mother.</i> Ah, well, we musn't be 'ard on her, if
    that's so.</p>

    <p><i>The O. of the H.</i> (<i>removing the obstruction</i>). I
    'ope you're satisfied <i>now</i>, I'm sure?</p>

    <p><i>The Father</i> (<i>handsomely</i>). Better late nor
    never, Mum, and we take it kind of you. Though, why you
    shouldn't ha' done it at fust, I dunno; for you look a deal
    'ansomer without the 'at than, what you did in
    it&mdash;<i>don't</i> she, MARIA?</p>

    <p><i>The O. of the H.</i> (<i>mollified</i>). SAM, ask the
    gentleman behind if his boy would like a ginger-nut.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>This olive-branch is accepted; compliments pass;
        cordiality is restored, and the Pantomime proceeds without
        further disturbance.</i></p>

    <h2>SOMETHING LIKE A SUBSCRIPTION!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from the Book of Philanthropy.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The Committee waited impatiently the arrival of the Great
    and Good Man. It was their duty to obtain a donation&mdash;an
    ample one&mdash;from the Millionnaire whose charity was
    renowned far and wide, from one end of the world to the other.
    At length he appeared before them.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/49-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"What can I do for you?" he asked, with a smile that
    absolutely shone with benevolence.</p>

    <p>"You know, Sir, that the claims of the poor in the Winter
    are numerous, and difficult to meet?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly I do," returned the Man of Wealth, "and hope that
    you are about to ask me for a subscription."</p>

    <p>"Indeed we were," cried the spokesman of the Committee, his
    eyes filling with grateful tears. "May I put you down for five
    pounds?"</p>

    <p>"Five pounds!" echoed the Millionnaire, impatiently, "What
    is five pounds?&mdash;<i>five thousand</i> is much more like
    the figure! Now, I will give you five thousand pounds on one
    condition."</p>

    <p>"Name it!" cried the Deputation in a breath.</p>

    <p>"The simplest thing in the world," continued the
    Millionnaire. "I will give you five thousand pounds on the
    condition that you get ninety-nine other fellows to do the
    same. Nay, you shall thank me when all is collected. I can wait
    till then."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The above words were spoken more than thirty years ago.
    Since then the Deputation have been waiting for the other
    fellows&mdash;and so has the Millionnaire!</p>

    <h3>Professor v. Professor.</h3>

    <p>PROFESSOR VIRCHOW seems by no means Koch-sure about the
    <i>tuberculosis</i> remedy. Indeed Professor KOCH finds that
    there is not only "much virtue in an 'if,'" but much "if" in a
    VIRCHOW! He is inclined to sing with SWINBURNE:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>CAPITAL AND LABOUR FORECAST;</h2>

    <h4><i>Or, Six of One and Half-a-Dozen of the Other.</i></h4>

    <p>Though in some quarters a better feeling was reported to
    have prevailed, still, according to latest accounts, the
    outlook can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory. A meeting of
    the Amalgamated Engineering Tram-Drivers' Mutual
    Stand-Shoulder-to-Shoulder Strangulation Society was held on
    Glasgow Green yesterday afternoon, at which, amid a good deal
    of boisterous interruption, several delegates addressed the
    assembled audience and recounted their recent experiences up to
    date. There were still 1700 of the Company's old hands out of
    work, and though, thanks to the profound enthusiasm, "their
    just cause" had excited amidst the Trade Societies in the
    South, by which, owing to subscriptions from no less important
    bodies than the Bootmakers' Benevolent Grandmothers'
    Association, and Superannuated Undertakers' Orphan Society,
    they had been able to stay out and defy the Company, receiving
    all the while, every man of them, a stipend of 3<i>s.</i>
    9<i>d.</i> a-week, still they had almost come to the end of
    their resources, and all that they had in hand towards next
    week's fund for distribution, was £1 13<i>s.</i>
    7-1/2<i>d.</i>, received in coppers from the Deputy-Chairman of
    the Metropolitan Boys' Boot-blacking Brigade, accompanied with
    an intimation that that help must be regarded as the last that
    can be counted on from that quarter. Under these circumstances
    it became a question whether it was not almost time to consider
    some terms of compromise.</p>

    <p>In the above sense one of the speakers addressed the
    meeting, but he was speedily followed by another, who insisted
    that, "come what might," they would stick to their latest
    terms, which were, a three-hours' day&mdash;(<i>loud
    cheers</i>)&mdash;and time-and-three-quarters for any work
    expected after three o'clock in the afternoon. (<i>Prolonged
    cheering</i>.)</p>

    <p>A Delegate here rose, and said it was all very well their
    cheering, but could they get it? (<i>A Voice, "We'll try!"</i>)
    For his part, the speaker continued, he had had enough of
    trying. With wife and children starving at home, he had only
    one course open to him, and that was, to knock under to the
    Company and their ten-hours' day, if they would have him.
    (<i>Groans, amid which the Speaker had his hat knocked over his
    eyes, and was kicked out of the assembly</i>.)</p>

    <p>The discussion was then continued, much in the same vein,
    and eventually culminated in a free fight, in which the
    Chairman got his head broken, on declaring that a Motion
    further limiting the working day to two hours and a half, was
    lost by a narrow majority.</p>

    <p>Yesterday afternoon the Directors' Mutual Anti-Labour
    Protection Company met at their Central Offices for the
    despatch of their usual business. The ordinary Report was read,
    which announced that though the affairs of three great Railway
    Companies had "gone" literally "to the dogs," still, the
    Directors of each had to be congratulated on showing a firm
    front, in refusing to acknowledge even the existence of their
    <i>employés</i>. The usual congratulatory Motions were put,
    <i>pro formâ</i>, and passed, and, amid a general manifestation
    of gloomy satisfaction, the meeting was further adjourned.</p>

    <p>We sent our Musical Box (Cox being unable to accompany him
    on the piano or any other instrument, by reason of the severe
    weather) to hear STAVENHAGEN at St. James's Hall, Thursday
    last, the 22nd. Our Musical B. was nearly turned out of the
    hall, he was in such ecstasies of delight over a Beethovenly
    <i>concerto</i>, which "bangs Banagher," he said, subsequently
    translating the expression by explaining, "that is, beats
    BEETHOVEN." Our M.B. wept over a <i>cadenza</i> composed by the
    performer, and was only restored by the appearance&mdash;her
    first&mdash;of Madame STAVENHAGEN, who gave somebody's grand
    <i>scena</i> far better, probably, than that somebody could
    have given it himself, set as it was to fine descriptive music
    by the clever STAVENHAGEN, which delighted all hearers,
    especially those who were Liszt-eners. "Altogether," writes our
    Musical Box, "a very big success. Music is thirsty work. I am
    now about to do a symphony in B. and S."</p>

    <h4><i>Or, The Dook, the Dancing Girl, and the Little Lame
    Duck.</i></h4>

    <p>What is to be admired in ENERY HAUTHOR JONES is not so much
    his work but his pluck,&mdash;for has he not, in the first
    place, overcome the prudery of the Lord Chamberlain's Licensing
    Department, and, in the second place, has he not introduced on
    the boards of the Haymarket a good old-fashioned Melodrama,
    brought "up to date," and disguised in a Comedy wrapper? Walk
    in, Ladies and Gentlemen, and see <i>The Dancing Girl</i>, a
    Comedy-Drama shall we call it, or, generically, a Play? wherein
    the prominent figures are a wicked Duke,&mdash;<i>vice</i> the
    "wicked Baronet," now shelved, as nothing under the ducal rank
    will suit us nowadays, bless you!&mdash;a Provincial Puritan
    family, an honest bumpkin lover, a devil of a dancing woman who
    lives a double-shuffling sort of life, an angel of a lame
    girl,&mdash;who, of course, can't cut capers but goes in for
    coronets,&mdash;a sly, unprincipled, and calculating kind of
    angel she is too, but an audience that loves Melodrama is above
    indulging in uncharitable analysis of motive,&mdash;a town
    swell in the country, a more or less unscrupulous land-agent,
    and a genuine, honest "heavy father," of the ancient type, with
    a good old-fashioned melodramatic father's curse ready at the
    right moment, the last relic of a bygone period of the
    transpontine Melodrama, which will bring tears to the eyes of
    many an elderly playgoer on hearing the old familiar formula,
    in the old familiar situation, reproduced on the stage of the
    modern Haymarket as if through the medium of a phonophone.</p>

    <p>At all events, <i>Drusilla Ives, alias</i> "the Dancing Girl
    "&mdash;though as to where she dances, how she dances, and when
    she dances, we are left pretty well in the dark, as she only
    gives so slight a taste of her quality that it seemed like a
    very amateurish imitation of Miss KATE VAUGHAN in her best
    day,&mdash;<i>Drusilla Ives</i> is the mistress, neither pure
    nor simple, of the <i>Duke of Guisebury</i>,&mdash;a title
    which is evidently artfully intended by the, at present, "Only
    JONES" to be a compound of the French "Guise" and the English
    "Bury,"&mdash;who from his way of going on and playing old
    gooseberry with his property, might have been thus styled with
    advantage: and so henceforth let us think and speak of him as
    His Grace or His Disgrace the Duke of Gooseberry.</p>

    <p>This Duke of Gooseberry visits, "quite
    unbeknown,"&mdash;being, for this occasion only, the Duke of
    Disguisebury,&mdash;his own property, the Island of St.
    Endellion, just to see, we suppose, what sort of people the
    Quaker family may be from which his mistress, the Dancing
    Quakeress (and how funny she used to be at the Music Halls and
    at the Gaiety!), has sprung. For some reason or other, the
    Dancing Quakeress has gone to stay a few weeks with her family
    in the country, and while this hypocritical Daughter of
    HERODIAS is with her Quaker belongings at prayers in the
    Meeting House, the spirit moveth her to come out, and to come
    out uncommonly strong, as, within a yard or so of the building,
    she laughs and talks loudly with Gooseberry, and then in a
    light-hearted way she treats the Dook to some amateur
    imitations of ELLEN TERRY, finishing up with a reminiscence of
    KATE VAUGHAN; all of which <i>al fresco</i> entertainment is
    given for the benefit of the aforesaid Gooseberry within sound
    of the sermon and within sight of the Meeting House windows.
    Suddenly her rustic Quaker lover, a kind of <i>Ham
    Peggotty</i>, lounges out of the Conventicle, which, as these
    persons seem to leave and enter just when it suits them, ought
    rather to be called a Chapel-of-Ease,&mdash;and, like the clown
    that he is, says in effect, "I'm a-looking at yer! I've caught
    yer at it!" Dismay of Dook and Dancer!! then Curtain on a most
    emphatically effective situation.</p>

             a <i>tête-à-tête.</i>
    </div>

    <p>The Second Act is far away the best of the lot, damaged,
    however, by vain repetitions of words and actions. To the house
    where Miss Dancing Girl is openly living under the protection
    of Gooseberry, the Duke's worthy Steward actually brings his
    virtuous and ingenuous young daughter! If ever there were a
    pair of artful, contriving, scheming humbugs, it is this worthy
    couple. Because the Duke saved her from being run over by his
    own horses, therefore she considers herself at liberty to limp
    after him, and round him, and about him, on every possible
    occasion, to say sharp, priggish things to him, to make love to
    him, and in the Third Act so craftily to manage as to spot him
    just as he is about to drink off a phial of poison, which
    operation, being preceded by a soliloquy of strong theatrical
    flavour and considerable length, gives the lame girl a fair
    chance of hobbling down the stairs and arresting the thus
    "spotted Nobleman's" arm at the critical moment. Curtain, and a
    really fine dramatic situation. "Which nobody can deny."</p>

    <p>It is in this same Third Act that the fine old crusted
    melodramatic curse is uncorked, and a good imperial quart of
    wrath is poured out on his dancing daughter's head by the heavy
    father, who, in his country suit, forces his way into the
    gilded halls of the Duke's mansion, past the flunkeys, the head
    butler, and all the rest of the usual pampered menials. An
    audience that can accept this old-fashioned cheap-novel kind of
    clap-trap, and witness, without surprise, the marvellous
    departure of all the guests, supperless, for no assigned cause,
    or explicable reason, not even an alarm of fire having been
    given, will swallow a considerable amount.</p>

        lame Duck of a Daughter, Sybil Slyboots, <i>alias</i> Becky
        Sharp, afterwards the Merry Duchess of Gooseberry.
    </div>

    <p>The Fourth Act is an anticlimax, and shows up the faulty
    construction of the drama. Of course the news comes that the
    Dancing Girl is dead, and this information is brought by a
    Sainte Nitouche of a "Sister" of some Theatrical Order (not
    admitted after half-past seven), whose very appearance is a
    <i>suggestio falsi</i>. Equally, of course, a letter is found,
    which, as exculpating Gooseberry, induces the old cuss of a
    Puritan father to shake hands with the converted "Spotted
    Nobleman"; but, be it remembered, the Dook is still his
    landlord, and the value of the property is going up
    considerably. Then it appears that the old humbug of an agent
    has sagaciously speculated in the improvement of the island,
    and poor Gooseberry feels under such an obligation to that sly
    puss of an agent's daughter, that, in a melancholy sort of way,
    he offers her his hand, which she, the artful little hussy of a
    <i>Becky Sharp</i>, with considerable affectation of coyness,
    accepts, and down goes the Curtain upon as unsatisfactory and
    commonplace a termination to a good Melodrama as any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> Philistine of the Philistines
       could possibly wish. It would have been a human tragedy
       indeed had poor Gooseberry poisoned himself, and the girl
       whose life he had saved had arrived just too late, only to
       die of a broken heart. But that "is quite another
       story."</p>

    <p>The piece is well played all round, especially by the men.
    Mr. TREE is excellent, except in the ultra-melodramatic parts,
    where he is too noisy. The very best thing he does is the
    perfect finish of the Second Act, when, without a word, he sits
    in the chair before the fire lost in dismal thought. This is
    admirable: as perfect in its dramatic force as it is true to
    nature. It is without exception the best thing in the whole
    piece. Mr. F. KERR as <i>Reginald Slingsby</i>, achieves a
    success unequalled since Mr. BANCROFT played the <i>parvenu</i>
    swell <i>Hawtree</i>. It should be borne in mind that Mr. KERR
    only recently played admirably the poor stuttering shabby lover
    in <i>The Struggle for Life. Il ira loin, ce bon</i> M. KERR.
    Miss JULIA NEILSON looks the part to the life: when she has
    ceased to give occasional imitations of Miss ELLEN TERRY, and
    can really play the part as well as she looks it, then nothing
    more could be possibly desired. All the others as good as need
    be, or can be.</p>

    <h2>WAKING THEM UP.</h2>

    <h4><i>Fly-leaf from an Energetic Kaiser's Diary.</i></h4>

    <p>10 P.M.&mdash;Slip out of Opera and take somebody else's
    overcoat from cloak-room when nobody is looking, jump into a
    four-wheeler, and drive to station. Am recognised, and a
    special train is called out. Give them the slip, and get into a
    horse-box of third-class omnibus-train just about to start.</p>

    <p>10.15 P.M. <i>to</i> 2.30 A.M.&mdash;Still in horse-box.</p>

    <p>2.45 AM.&mdash;Stop at a big town. Hurry out. Stopped for
    ticket. Throw off disguise of somebody else's overcoat, and
    declare myself. Guard called out to escort me. When they are
    looking the other way, hide under refreshment-counter, and get
    out of station unobserved on all-fours. Am collared by a
    policeman. Again have to declare myself. Give policeman twenty
    marks, bind him to silence, and borrow his official cloak. Find
    out Burgomaster's address. Hammer at his front door till I have
    stirred up the whole household.</p>

    <p>4 A.M. <i>to</i> 5 A.M.&mdash;Find out the Archbishop. Bang
    at his front door till he puts his head out of window, and
    wants to know "What on earth's the matter?" Hide round the
    corner. Repeat same business, with more or less success, at the
    residence of the Chief Justice, then at that of the Clerk of
    the Peace, and at those of any other officials I can call to
    mind, winding up by a regular good row at that of the General
    in Command. Trumpeter comes out. Take bugle from him, and give
    the call. General in Command rubs his eyes sleepily, and says
    he'll be down presently.</p>

    <p>5 A.M.&mdash;Hurry back to station. Catch early cattle-train
    going back to Berlin. Jump on engine, and declare myself. Wire
    approach down line, and tear away with the cattle, at seventy
    miles an hour, getting back to Berlin just in time for
    breakfast. Fancy I woke them up! Altogether, a very enjoyable
    outing.</p>

    <h2>ROBERT ON SKATIN'.</h2>

    <p>Well, I begins to agree with them as says, and says it too
    as if they ment it, that noboddy can reelly tell what is reel
    grand injiyment till they trys it, and trys it farely, and
    gives it a good chance. I remembers how I used to try and like
    Crikkit, when I was much yunger than I am now, and stuck to it
    in spite of several black eyes when I stood pint, and shouts
    of, "Now then, Butter-Fingers!" when I stood leg, till a serten
    werry fast Bowler sent me away from the wicket with two black
    and blew legs, and then I guv it up. I guv up Foot Ball for
    simler reesuns, and have never attemted not nothink in the
    Hathlettick line ewer since, my sumwat rapid increase in size
    and wait a hading me in that wise resolooshun.</p>

    <p>But sumhow it appened, dooring the hawful whether we has all
    bin a shivering threw for this long time, that I found my
    atenshun direckted to the strange fack that, whilst amost
    ewerybody was busily engaged in a cussin and swarin at the
    bitter cold and the dirty slippery sno, ewerybody else seemed
    to be injying of theirselves like wun-a-clock. Now it so
    appened that when waiting one day upon the young swell I have
    before spoken of, at the "Grand 'Otel," he was jined by another
    swell, who told him what a glorius day's skating he had been
    avin in Hide Park! and how he ment to go agen to-morrer, "if
    the luvly frost wood but continue!"</p>

    <p>So my cureosety was naterally egsited, and nex day off I gos
    to Hide Park, and there I seed the xplanation of what had
    serprised me so much. For there was hunderds and hunderds of
    not only spectably drest Gents, but also of reel-looking Ladys,
    a skatin away like fun, and a larfing away and injying
    theirselves jest as if it had bin a nice Summer's day.
    Presently I append to find myself a standing jest by a nice
    respectabel looking man, with a nice, cumferal-looking chair,
    and seweral pares of Skates; and presently he says to me, quite
    permiscus-like, "They all seems to be a injying theirselves,
    don't they, Sir?" which they most suttenly did; and then he
    says to me, says he, "Do you skate, Sir?" to which my natral
    pride made me reply, "Not much!" "Will you have a pair on.
    Sir," says he, "jest for a trial?" "Is there any fear of a
    axident?" says I. "Oh no. Sir," says he, "not if you follers my
    hinstrucshuns." So I acshally sets myself down in his chair,
    and lets him put me on a pair of Skates! The first differculty
    was, how to get up, which I found as I coudn't manage at all
    without his asistance; for, strange to say, both of my feet
    insisted on going quite contrary ways. Howewer, by grarsping on
    him quite tite round his waste, I at last manidged to go along
    three or four slides, and then I returned to the chair, and sat
    down again; and he was kind enuff to compliment me, and to say
    that he thort I was a gitting on fust-rate, and, if I woud only
    cum ewery day for about a week or so, he had no dowt but he
    shood see me a skating a figger of hate like the best on
    'em!</p>

    <p>Hencouraged by his truthfool remarks, I at larst wentured to
    let go of him and try a few slides by myself, and shood no dowt
    have suckseeded hadmerably, but my bootifal stick to which I
    was a trustin to elp me from falling, slided rite away from me
    in a most unnatral manner, and down I came on my onerabel seat,
    with such a smasher as seemed to shake all my foreteen stun
    into a cocked-hat, to speak, hallegorically, and there I lay,
    elpless and opeless, and wundring how on airth I shood ever get
    up again. But my trusty frend and guide was soon at my side, as
    the Poet says, but all his united force, with that of too boys
    who came to his assistance, and larfed all the wile, as rude
    boys will, coud not get me on my feet agen 'till my too skates
    was taken off, and I agen found myself on <i>terror fermer</i>
    on my friend's chair. It took me longer to recover myself than
    I shood have thort posserbel, but at larst I was enabled to
    crawl away, but not 'till my frend had supplied me with jest a
    nice nip of brandy, which he said he kept andy in case of any
    such surprisin axidents as had appened to me.</p>

    <p>So what with paying for the use of the skates, and the use
    of the Brandy, and the use of the too boys, and the use of a
    handsum Cab to take me to the "Grand," that was rayther a deer
    ten minutes skating, and as it was reelly and trewly my fust
    attemt at that poplar and xciting passtime, I think I may
    safely affirm&mdash;as I have alreddy done to my better
    harf&mdash;whose langwidge, when I related my hadwentur, is
    scarcely worth repeating, as it was most certenly not
    complementary&mdash;that it shall be my larst. ROBERT.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Thursday, January 22</i>.&mdash;Both
    Houses met to-day after Christmas Recess. No QUEEN's Speech; no
    moving and seconding of Address; no Royal Commission and
    procession of SPEAKER to Lords. All seems strange, and spirits
    generally a little depressed. Only ROBERT FOWLER rises superior
    to circumstances of hour. Blustering about the Lobby "like
    Boreas," says CAUSTON.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"Only not so rude," says HARRY LAWSON, jealous for the
    reputation of Metropolitan Members, even though some sit on the
    Benches opposite. With folded hands thrust behind coat-tails,
    rollicking stride, thunderous voice, and blooming countenance,
    Sir ROBERT positively pervades the Lobby. Personally receives
    POPE HENNESSY; shakes hands with everybody; and finally halting
    for a moment under the electric-lit archway leading into House,
    presents interesting and attractive picture of the Glorified
    Alderman.</p>

    <p>Scotch Members take possession of Commons to-night. LORD
    ADVOCATE brings in Bill, providing new machinery for private
    legislation; the Scotch Members with one accord fall upon
    proposal, and tear it to ribbons. Meanwhile other Members troop
    off to Lords, where spectacle is provided which beats the
    pantomimes into fits. Two new Peers to take their seats;
    procession formed in back room outside; enters from below Bar.
    First comes Black Rod, with nothing black about him; then
    Garter King-at-Arms, a herculean personage, fully five feet
    high, with a dangerous gleam in his eye, and the Royal Arms of
    England quartered in scarlet and blue and gold on his manly
    back. Behind, in red cloaks slashed with ermine, the new Baron
    and his escort of two brother Peers. There being no room for
    them to advance in due procession, they fall into single file,
    make their way to the Woolsack, where sits that pink of
    chivalry, that mould of fashion, that perfection of form, the
    LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR.</p>

    <p>New Peer drops on one knee, presents bundle of paper to LORD
    CHANCELLOR. L.C., coyly turning his head on one side, gingerly
    takes roll, hands it to Attendant. New Peer gets up; procession
    bundles back to table; here Gentleman in wig and gown gabbles
    something from long document. New Peer writes his name in a
    book (probably promising subscription towards expenses of
    performance.) Garter King-at-Arms getting to the front trots
    off with comically short strides for so great a dignity; New
    Peer and escort follow, Black Rod solemnly bringing up rear.
    Garter King makes for Cross Benches by the door; passes along
    one, the rest following, as if playing game of
    Follow-my-leader. Garter King suddenly making off to the right,
    walks up Gangway to row of empty Benches. Stops at the topmost
    row but one, and passes along. New Peer wants to follow him.
    Garter King prods him in chest with small stick, and tells him
    to go on to the Bench above. This he does, with escort.
    Meanwhile, Black Rod left out in the cold. Garter King motions
    to three Peers to be seated; tells them to put on their
    cocked-hats; counts ten; nods to them; they rise to feet,
    uplift cocked-hats in direction of LORD CHANCELLOR on Woolsack.
    He raises his in return of salute. Three Peers sit down again.
    Garter King counts ten; nods; up they get again, salute LORD
    CHANCELLOR; sit down once more.
    "One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;ten," Garter King
    mumbles to himself. Once more they rise; salute LORD
    CHANCELLOR; then Garter King leading the way, they march back
    to Woolsack.</p>

    <p>Garter King now introduces new Member to LORD CHANCELLOR.
    L.C. starts as if he had never seen him before; then extends
    right <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> hand; New Peer shakes it,
       procession reformed, walks out behind Bar. A few minutes
       later, another comes in, all the business done over again.
       Impressive, but a little monotonous, and as soon as possible
       after its conclusion Noble Lords go home.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;In Commons, Private Bill
    Legislation Bill read a Second Time.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;WM. O'BRIEN, standing with tear-stained
    face on pier at Boulogne waving wet handkerchief across the
    main, has drawn away JUSTIN McCARTHY, who can't be back till
    Monday. PARNELL was to have come down to-day, and, making
    believe to be still Leader of United Irishmen, asked OLD
    MORALITY to set aside day for discussion of his Motion on
    operation of Crimes Act. BRER FOX accordingly looked in shortly
    after SPEAKER took the Chair.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/60-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/60-1.png"
             alt="Dr. Channing in the Pulpit." /></a>Dr. Channing
             in the Pulpit.
    </div>

    <p>"Seen BRER RABBIT anywhere about, TOBY?" he asked.</p>

    <p>So I up and told him about McCARTHY's new journey to
    Boulogne.</p>

    <p>"Oh, indeed," said BRER FOX; "if that's the case, I think I
    won't trouble House to-night. Got an engagement elsewhere;
    think I'll go and keep it. Not used to hanging about here, as
    you know; awful bore to me; but as long as BRER RABBIT comes
    here, I must be on spot to vindicate my position. So I'll say
    ta-ta. No&mdash;never mind ringing for fire-escape; can walk
    down the steps to-day."</p>

    <p>Thus there being no Irish Leader on the premises, and hardly
    any Irish Members, had a rare chance for attending to British
    business. CHANNING brought on question of working Overtime on
    the Railways; moved Resolution invoking interference of Board
    of Trade. Question a little awkward for Government. Couldn't
    afford to offend Railway Directors, yet wouldn't do to flout
    numerous body of working-men, chiefly voters. Proposed to
    shelve business by appointment of Select Committee. Opposition
    not going to let them off so easily. Debate kept up all night,
    winding up with critical Division; Government majority only
    17.</p>

    <p>"And this," said OLD MORALITY, with injured look, "after
    PLUNKET's brilliant oration on the time-tables of the London
    and North-Western Railway Company! If he'd only illustrated it
    with magic-lantern, things would have gone differently." But he
    was obstinate; said there would be difficulty in arranging the
    slides, and so rejected proposal.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;CHANNING's Resolution about
    Overtime on Railways negatived by 141 Votes against 124.</p>

    <h2>HOMAGE TO SIR JAMES HANNEN.</h2>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;As the recognised organ of the legal profession,
    will you permit me to address you? It is common knowledge that
    within the last few days the Right Honourable Sir JAMES HANNEN
    has been raised to a dignity greater than that he has been able
    to claim for the last eighteen years, when he has sat as
    President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of
    the High Court of Justice. On leaving the Court in which so
    many of us were known to him, he was kind enough to say, "Those
    eighteen years had been eighteen years of happiness to him,
    chiefly arising from the advantage he had had in having before
    him habitually practising in that Court Barristers who had felt
    that their part was just as important as his in the
    administration of Justice, and who had assisted him enormously.
    Without their assistance, his task would have been an arduous
    one, whereas it had been, as he had said, an agreeable one." As
    I personally have had the honour of appearing before his
    Lordship for many years, I think that it is only right that I
    should make some acknowledgment of this kind recognition of my
    services.</p>

    <p>It is quite true that I have felt, as Sir JAMES HANNEN
    suggests, that my part (humble as it may have been) has been
    just as important as his in the administration of Justice. But
    it is gratifying to me beyond measure to learn that my
    invariable custom of bowing to his Lordship on the commencement
    and conclusion of each day's forensic duties&mdash;which has
    been the limit of my "habitual practice" in the Probate
    Division&mdash;should "have assisted him enormously." I can
    only say that, thanks to his unvarying kindness and courtesy,
    my daily recognition of his greetings from the Bench, instead
    of being an arduous task, has ever been an agreeable one. I
    have the honour to remain, Sir, your very obedient servant,</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>)</p>

    <p>"PRO-DIGIOUS!"&mdash;In last Sunday's <i>Observer</i> we
    read that at St. Petersburg Madame MELBA, as <i>Juliette, "was

    italics are ours, rather! If this sort of thing is to be
    repeated during the Opera season here, and each gifted singer
    is recalled in proportion to his or her merits, the audience
    will not get away till the following morning. <i>Juliette</i>
    must have said, on the above-mentioned occasion, "Parting is
    such sweet sorrow, That I could say 'good-night' until
    to-morrow." And the usual chorus of operatic <i>habitués</i>
    will be, "We won't go home till morning. Till daylight doth
    appear!" with <i>refrain</i>, "For&mdash;she (or he)'s a jolly

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
